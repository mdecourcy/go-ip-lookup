# ip lookup

Quick tool I wrote up for IP lookups using the IP2Loc DB. To use, download the 'IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB9.BIN' from their site, to /data/db/. 

# To use

You can access the IP lookup by navigating to 

```
http://localhost:8080/ip/{ip_address_to_lookup}
```
Post requests with multiple IPs coming soon
